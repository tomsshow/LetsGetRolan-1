          This is an explanation of how this webpage is hosted. It is running on
          a Raspberry pie through a Cisco ASA and uses dynamic DNS through
          google. This is a long tutorial and some parts will have links to
          Youtube tutorials that I followed in order to get this to work. I
          appologize in advance if some parts may be missing, unclear or if the

          This is a short explanation of how I created this website using
          tutorials over multiple Youtube videos and knowledge acquired from
          studying for my CCNA Exams. Be aware that there are risks when
          allowing people to access any device on your network from the
          internet. I am not responsable/liable for anything that may happen to
          your Raspberry Pi or other devices on your network. This is intended
          solely for educational purposes. Now lets get Rolan.

      <div class="required materials">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Required Materials</h2>
        <li>
          Cisco ASA - In this tutorial I use an ASA 5510. I recomended you buy
          one that is licenced to support multiple VLANs and has the latest
          patchs pre-installed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raspberry pie 3b or better with at least 8Gb of storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serial cable for connecting to the consol port of your ASA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Putty installed on your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some ethernet cables.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Domain name bought through Google.

      <div class="Setting up your Pi">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Setting up your Raspberry Pi.</h2>
        <p>
          There are many tutorials accross Youtube which will show you how to
          set up an OS on your Raspberry Pi. At the time of writing this I am
          currently using "Raspian Buster with desktop". If you are more
          familiar with Linux command line interface I recomend you use the
          "Lite" version because it is less resource intensive on your device.
          However for this tutorial I use the desktop version because it is a
          bit more user friendly and should work just as well.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Setting up your ASA">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Setting up your ASA.</h2>
        <p>
          Connect serial cable to console port Open and putty and select SERIAL.
          leave the speed at 9600 and then chose your serial line. (This will
          vary from person to person and can be checked through device manager)
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup1.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Once in the ASA console type “enable” or “en” for short. You should
          then be prompted to enter a password. If this is your first time, then
          there should be no password and instead you can just press enter.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup2.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          You will now be in enable mode/Exec mode. You can tell because the >
          symbol after the host name has changed to #. To enter global
          configuration you will now by type “configure terminal” or you can
          shorten it to something like “con t”. (Note: My ASA came with factory
          defaults which set vlan1 to the 192 private address with DHCP enabled.
          You must remove DHCP first before you can assign any other ip address
          to the VLAN)
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup3.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Then you will want to assign an interface to VLAN 1 and make sure the
          interface is on.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup4.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Next we will want to configure VLAN 1 for the inside with a security
          level of 100 and an ip address. In this case I used 10.0.0.0/24
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup5.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          To communicate with the ASDM we need to enable http services and then
          let the ASA know which IP addresses are allowed to have ASDM sessions.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup6.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          For the next part you will want to connect an ethernet port from your
          computer to the interface you assigned for your inside interface.
          (e0/5) Since we have disabled DHCP and assigned the inside as 10.0.0.1
          you will want to statically set the IP of your computer. (This will
          vary on which type of computer you hace). In this case we have set our
          IP to 10.0.0.2 (You can set it to any other IP so long as it falls
          within the range of your subnet). From here you can use any browser to
          go to the IP address you assigned to VLAN 1 (This is also your default
          gateway). Since the ASA is a self signed certificate and not from a CA
          server your browser recognizes you will most likely get a warning. You
          can just click continue.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup7.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          From here you can then download and install Ciscos ASDM which will let
          you control the ASA through a GUI. (The version of your ASDM will
          depends on what comes preloaded with your ASA). You will need java
          downloaded to run the ASA. Before we can launch and run the ASDM we
          have to download a copy of the ASAs digital certificate to put into
          java or else it will not launch. (Downloading the certificate will
          vary depending on what browser you use). Once you have downloaded the
          digital certificate search “configure java” and go to the security
          tab. From here edit the site list and put in the IP of the ASA which
          you used to connect and download the ASDM.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup8.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Select the “manage Certificates” option and then import the
          certificate you just downloaded into “trusted certificates” and
          “secure sites”. You can then run the ASDM and connect to the IP
          address you used to download the ASDM. By default unless you have set
          it up the ASA has no username and password.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ASAsetup/ASAsetup9.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Congratulations you have set up your ASA and now should be able to
          configure it further VIA ASDM
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Configuring ASA interfaces">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Configuring ASA Interfaces.</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have your ASDM open in order to start configuring our
          Interfaces we will go to Configuration > Device Setup > interface
          Seeting > Interfaces. (Note: In this example I had already configured
          my interfaces so when configuring your interface it might look a bit
          different from mine. This will also change based on which ASDM version
          you are running and the patch level running on your ASA.)
        </p>
        <img src="img/Interface/Int_conf1.jpg" alt="John doe" />
        <p>
          In order set up connection to the internet we will need to make a port
          for it. (Note: Some interfaces come with one preconfigured for this).
          First will start by selecting add to bring up the configuration
          window. For the hardware port you will select the interface you wish
          to use to connect to the internet and you will want to give it a name.
          For the security level we will set it to 0 but you can set it to any
          number 0-100 so long as it is a lower level than all your other ports.
          By default traffic from your interfaces are able to travel from a
          higher level to a lower level but lower levels can travel to higher
          levels unless you specifically put in an access list for it. You will
          want to make sure to check off the "enable interface" box to make sure
          its on and bellow where it says "IP Address" will want to select
          "Obtain Address via DHCP". Since my ASA is hooked dirrectly to the
          cable modem I recieve a public assigned DHCP address from my service
          provider. (Note: You might have to reset your modem.) Check off Use
          "Cisco", "Obtain default route using DHCP", and set the "DHCP learned
          route MEtric" to 1. Once you have done those steps you can select
          "Okay".
        </p>
        <img src="img/Interface/int_conf2.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          The next interface will setup is the interface we will use for our
          raspberry pie/web server. For the first half we will set it up the
          similar to the way we set up the outside ineterface but instead of
          checking off "obtain address via DHCP" we will check off "use static
          IP". You will then assign an IP address (One from the range of private
          IPs), set your subnet mask and click ok.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Interface/int_conf3.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          You will now have 3 interfaces configured and you can select apply and
          save.

        <h2 class="text-secondary">Static IP for your Pie</h2>
        <p>
          This was the youtube tutorial I used in order to setup a static IP on
          my Raspberry pie using the command line interface. You will want to
          make sure you set the IP to a host that resides in the subnet of your
          DMZ and set the default gateway of the IP for this interface too.
          Finally of course connect it to the interface you configured for your
          Raspberry Pie.

          Since we are using the GUI version of linux we can replace the files
          easier. By typing "sudo pcmanfm" in the consol it will give us a
          window that has administrative rights to edit permsions of files.

      <div class="Out-in-process">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Connecting Inside -> Outside (PAT)</h2>
        <p>
          In order to establish network connectivity from our inside interface
          to the outside we need to configure NAT (Network Address Translation)
          or in this case PAT (Port address translation). This can be done by
          going to “NAT Rules” under the configuration tab of the ASDM.
        </p>
        <img src="img/In_out/In_out1.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Towards the top you will see an Add button then select Add “Network
          Object” NAT Rule from the drop down menu
        </p>
        <img src="img/In_out/In_out2.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          From here you will give the Network Object a name and change the type
          to “Network. You will want to use the ip address and mask of the
          inside interface. The description is optional but recommended. In the
          lower section you will want to change the type to “Dynamic PAT (Hide)
          and set the translated address to the outside interface.
        </p>
        <img src="img/In_out/In_out3.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Once done click ok and apply. As always make sure to save your
          changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Port forwarding">
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Port forwarding</h2>
        <p>
          To allow connections from the outside to the raspberry pie we need to
          set up port forwarding. In order to do this we start by going to NAT
          rules on our ASA and clicking add, add "Network Object" NAT rule just
          like what we did for creating our inside to out NAT rule.
        </p>
        <img src="img/In_out/In_out2.JPG" alt="Johm doe" />
        <p>
          Will add a name and leave the type as “host”. For the IP address will
          add the internal IP address of the raspberry pies Static IP address.
          For the bottom area bellow “NAT” will leave the type as “static” and
          then select the outside interface for the translated address. At the
          very bottom you will want to then click the “advanced” button
        </p>
        <img src="img/Port_forwarding/Port_forwarding2.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          The source interface is going to be inside, and the destination will
          be outside. You will leave the protocol as TCP and change the real and
          mapped port to http. Finally click ok then ok again and apply.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Port_forwarding/Port_forwarding3.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          For the last part we are going to go to “access rules” and then “add”.
          (In this example I had already added the access list). Will want to
          select the outside interface and make sure the action is set to
          “permit”. Source will be any and the destination will be whatever
          named you used before when setting up NAT. The service will be http
          and then you’ll select ok than apply.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Port_forwarding/Port_forwarding4.JPG" alt="John Doe" />
        <p>
          Now anyone who visits the IP of your outside interface using a web
          browser will be forwarded to your website.

        <p>
          This is a bare minimum on how to host a website on a raspberry pie
          through an ASA. There is always more you can do like adding an IPS
          modual (Highly recomend) for increased security or a syslog server for
          logging network network access and other events. You can also try out
          other things like creating a radius or LDAP server on a pie for remote
          access to things like a NAS setup. Try different things and keep on
          rolan
